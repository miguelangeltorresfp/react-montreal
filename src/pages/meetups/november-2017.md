    presentationTitle: How far can we take sharing code between React DOM and React Native?
    text: >-
      Kenza is a React & React Native developer, who developed several monorepo
      applications using both technologies. She believes a strong advantages
      React Native has over other cross-platform mobile development libraries is
      the ability to share code between the web frontend and the mobile apps, as
      they're both written in React and JS. In this talk, she will share her
      current strategies, and investigates some experimental options like
      ReactXP and React Native Web.
