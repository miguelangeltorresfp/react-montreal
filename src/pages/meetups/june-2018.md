    presentationTitle: Should you use React Native?
    text: >-
      Thomas will be discussing the aftermath of Airbnb sunsetting React Native
      and reverting back to fully native mobile development. As a result of that
      decision, many companies are wondering whether React Native is still a
      good option, considering one of the big names in the field decided to move
      on from it.
