    presentationTitle: 10 things the media hasn't told you about React Native
    text: >-
      Beyond the initial feeling of wonder while building mobile interfaces
      easily and quickly, React Native adopters can feel frustrated when comes
      the time to transform a proof-of-concept into a production-ready
      application. Let us take a look at how React Native works under the hood
      to have a good grasp of the framework architecture and how to deal with
      advanced concepts like layout, styling, navigation, performance, testing
      and so on.
