    presentationTitle: Building your own native modules
    text: >-
      React Native is a powerful technology in that it allows you to build 90%
      of the things you need out of the box, but provides you with a way to
      build the 10% left in a custom way, using Native Modules. Ebou, a McGill
      student and part-time React Native developer, will show us what exactly is
      needed to build native modules.
