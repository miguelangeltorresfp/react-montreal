    Running the meetup requires places to host the meetup along with food and
    beverages to accomodate the meetup participants. We want to thank our
    sponsors for their help in making these meetups possible.

Here are some of the subjects we've covered in past meetups. If you're interested in participating by giving a talk, don't worry too much if we've touched on the subject before. New people join every day and there are a lot of subjects warranting a re-visit.
