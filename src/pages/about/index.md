## Sharing Ideas and Meeting Others

If you're working with React and/or React Native, or interested in learning, this group is for you! We meet every month to discuss progress with React, new tools, features and libraries. As people working with a young technology with best practices still yet to emerge, our focus is on helping the Montreal React community grow, and providing each other with input and advice and sharing our latest findings.
